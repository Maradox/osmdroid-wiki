## Fighting the dex method count limit? This page is for you. 

Since we can only run the dex counter on APKs, the best estimates we can give are on the sample/example applications.

* Open Map (this is the one in the play store) - OpenStreetMapViewer 13471, including 11k in android support stuff
* Forge Sample App - osmdroid-forge-app 22450, including 16k in android support stuff
* Google Maps Compat API Example - GoogleWrapper 55844, including 16k in android support stuff, 36k in google maps stuff

So in general, osmdroid is pretty small in terms of method counts.
