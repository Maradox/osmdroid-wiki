Fighting the dex limit? This page is for you. 

Since we can only run the dex counter on APKs, the best estimates we can give are on the sample/example applications.


* Open Map (this is the one in the play store) - OpenStreetMapViewer 13471, including 11k in android support stuff
* Forge Sample App - osmdroid-forge-app 21294, including 16k in android support stuff
* Google Maps Compat API Example - GoogleWrapper 55844, including 16k in android support stuff, 36k in google maps stuff

So in general, osmdroid is pretty small

"OpenStreetMapViewer 13471" : Is the apk file about 13 Megabytes??

My local OpenStreetMapViewer-debug.apk-file (where the AppCompat staff has been removed) generated from osmdroid-5.4 is 1130KB (about 1.1 Megabyte)
